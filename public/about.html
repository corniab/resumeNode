              Hello! My name is Ben and welcome to my page. I am excited that
              you are here. I grew up in a small town in Idaho. My summers there
              were filled with sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è and potatos ü•î. I eventually moved to
              Utah where I met my beautiful wife and now go to school full-time.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              I love to get lost in building and rebuilding software systems. In
              2020, I began studying software development at BYU-Idaho. My
              course curriculum has unfolded the power of programming languages,
              from SQL to JavaScript. This potential can be harnessed through
              development paradigms like object oriented programming and test
              driven development.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              As my studies come to a close, I am looking forward to entering
              the job market as full-time software developer. I am easy-going
              and inquisitive. I am not afraid to make mistakes and ask
              questions. I am convinced that the fastest way to learn something
              is through immersion. I will do whatever it takes to become a
              technical expert; whether it is digging into documentation or
              consulting with experts.
            </p>
